          <h3>Protecting Sight | Enhancing Vision</h3>
          <p>Eye Care Doctors of Optometry in Fredericksburg, Virginia welcomes you to our website to learn
            more about
            who
            we are and the quality services we provide. You can find our office conveniently located in
            Central
            Park,
            making us easily accessible to the greater Fredericksburg area including Stafford and
            Spotsylvania. Our
            four
            doctors—Dr. Adam H. Madison, Dr. Mitra S. Madison, Dr. Wade E. Fiegl, and Dr. Carissa
            Novotny—are
            available
            for appointment 6 days a week with extended hours Monday through Friday.</p>
          <p>Here at Eye Care Doctors of Optometry, we take pride in using the latest and greatest technology
            available.
            If you’ve ever heard our associates comment that the system is down, it’s probably because the
            server is
            being upgraded. Again. Not only do we use the latest software, but we bring in the newest
            hardware
            available
            too. Our prized tech right now is our Optos system, which only a few practices in Virginia have.
          </p>
          <p>We also carry a huge selection of brands; from King Baby to Versace, Nautica to Nike, and even
            Barbie to
            Disney, we have it all. That variety continues onto our lens selection where we have types,
            materials,
            and
            coatings to fit the needs of every individual. We’ve got sun protection and polarization for
            outside,
            blue
            tech for heavy computer use, and even transitions and anti-reflective for those in between.
            We’ll find a
            combination that works for you.</p>
          <p>Adult Eye Care is a large part of our practice, but we haven’t forgotten about all the aspiring
            Princesses,
            Astronauts, and Superheroes out there. By that, we mean our children. Many of us at Eye Care
            have
            children
            of our own, and we realize how important it is to ensure that their vision is every bit as
            healthy
            and
            protected as ours (if not more!) Our services come prepared to handle every Ariel, Neil, and
            Iron
            Man
            with
            child friendly projectors that show symbols instead of letters, specialized tests for more
            accurate
            diagnosis, and extensive knowledge from years of first hand experience and practice. We can’t
            guarantee
            your
            child will become a Superhero, but they’ll be seeing like one.</p>
          <p>At Eye Care Doctors of Optometry, we’ve got the latest technology, styles, and knowledge for
            every
            facet
            of
            your life. Eye care is our top priority and that makes you our top priority. You’ll see in the
            way
            that
            we
            treat you, that you are family. In fact, many of our current employees were actually patients
            that
            enjoyed
            Eye Care so much they came to work for us afterwards. So come in on, bring your kids (we could
            use a
            few
            more Superheros on the team), and let us protect your sight and enhance your vision.</p>
